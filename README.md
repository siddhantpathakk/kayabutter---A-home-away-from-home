## Description of the Problem 
Singapore is a global city and its people are particularly mobile. As of September 2020, there are 203,500 overseas Singaporeans across the globe in 2020. In 2019, prior to the
COVID-19 pandemic, average monthly expenditure on overseas travel increased from $260 to $340 in five years. Singaporeans who travel abroad to live, work, study, or play may be in need of services that link them back to Singapore. These range from administrative services like notifying the immigration authorities, updating their NS obligations or registering with overseas embassies or consulates, to social services like meeting other Singaporeans overseas to form their home way from home or perhaps locating resources overseas that would help the transition. Some Singaporeans may need to be in touch with the authorities when emergencies happen (medical, health, police, e.g. loss of passport or ID documents). For example, in March 17 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Education of Singapore issued an advisory encouraging Singaporean students based overseas to return to Singapore given the widening COVID-19 pandemic. Some Singaporeans live overseas for many years and are looking to transition back, with their children needing to be signed up for schools or perhaps there is a desire to catch up on what they have missed in their years away. And yet, some other Singaporeans are happy living overseas but still may want to foster links to Singapore, e.g. students may wish to meet Singaporeans who are working in their industry of choice overseas, or they may want to keep updated with Singapore news.

## Challenge Statement
Solutions that improve the quality of life of Singaporeans while they are overseas (either for short term or long-term)

## App Description
Kaya Butter is an app to bring Singaporeans together regardless of where they are on the globe.

## App Features
• Keep up with the latest news and announcements happening back in Singapore! No need to fomo! Government agencies can through this app connect with Singaporeans overseas with announcements.

• Network with Singaporean communities around you while overseas! They can be interest groups or school communities, join your kakis and chit-chat about anything to help with your transition to an unfamiliar environment!

## Why the name 'kayabutter'?
Inspiration came from kaya toast being such a staple breakfast in our life back in Singapore yet so difficult to find when overseas! In that sense, we hope to emulate the familiar experience of having kaya butter toast in Singapore while overseas, an everyday staple yet so unique and comforting to Singaporeans.

## Ideal Experience
SG users are able to obtain useful info about living abroad from SG communities around the world.

We were given 48 hours to make our first submission on DevPost.
